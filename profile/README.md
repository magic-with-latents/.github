## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We aim to explain new and complex ML tech to the community. This is our way of giving back to the community. Understanding any ML component comprehensively involves three things:

* Underlying math
* Conceptual framework of the component
* Corresponding code 

We're starting with a series on Diffusion models where we will dive deep into the fundamental math behind them as well as provide self-contained and readable code. 
We believe to be able to truly appreciate the power of innovations like Diffusion models, it's important to appreciate the science behind it -- hence the
series.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The organization aims to explain modern and complex ML tech to the community. Understanding any ML component comprehensively involves of three things:

* Underlying math
* Conceptual framework of the component
* Corresponding code 

We're starting with a series on Diffusion models where there will be deep dives into the fundamental math behind them as well as self-contained and readable code. 
We believe to be able to truly appreciate the power of innovations like Diffusion models, it's important to appreciate the science behind it -- hence the
series.
